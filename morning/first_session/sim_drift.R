  #		This will run 200 generations with 16 individuals are allowed to breed in each

  #		The experiment is replicated across 50 populations

  #		The function outputs a list with allele frequency of 'A' for each population at
  # 	each timestep (sim_ps); the frequency of 'Aa' for each population at each step
  #		(sim_hs); mean frequency of 'A' across populations for each step (p_hat); and the
  # 	mean heterozygosity across populations for each time step (hs_hat).

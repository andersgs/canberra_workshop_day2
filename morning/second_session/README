# First step, create an input file using the structure_input_file.R

#Second step, make sure mainparams and extraparams files are in order

#Third, run structure in parallel by using the following command
parallel ./par_struc.sh 5 ::: {0..24}
# This command will take run the par_struc.sh command with a maximum reps of 5
#  and it will run for a total of 25 runs. This will ensure that STRUCTURE runs
#  for K =1-5 with 5 reps each

#Fourth, run the parse_stuct.py file parse out the chains.
./parse_struct.py chain_K2

#Fifth, open the chains in R, and check for convergence
# use the structure_analysis.R

#Sixth, run structureHarvester.py
# It can be downloaded from here: http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~dearl/software/structureHarvester/
structureHarvester.py --dir=. --out=. --evanno --clumpp

#Use CLUMPP and Distruct
# That is left as homework
